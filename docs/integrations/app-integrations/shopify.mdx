This is the implementation of the Shopify app handler. It is responsible for fetching data from Shopify and utilizing it for training models and making predictions.

## Implementation

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

- `shop_url`: a required URL to your Shopify store.
- `access_token`: a required access token to use for authentication.

Here is how you can [create a Shopify access token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f_aiC5oTNc&t=302s).

## Usage

In order to connect your Shopify account to MindsDB, you must first create a new instance of the handler. You can do it by the following query:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE shopify_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'shopify',
PARAMETERS = {
  "shop_url": "your-shop-name.myshopify.com",
  "access_token": "shppa_..."
};
```

Once you have created the database, you can query it like any other database. For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM shopify_datasource.products
LIMIT 10;
```
